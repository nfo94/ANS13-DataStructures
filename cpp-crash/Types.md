1. Primitive Data Types: These data types are built - in or predefined data types
   and can be used directly by the user to declare variables.example : int, char,
   float, bool etc. Primitive data types available in C++ are :
   Integer
   Character
   Boolean
   Floating Point
   Double Floating Point
   Valueless or Void
   Wide Character

2. Derived Data Types : The data - types that are derived from the primitive or
   built - in datatypes are referred to as Derived Data Types. These can be of four
   types namely :
   Function
   Array
   Pointer
   Reference

3. Abstract or User - Defined Data Types : These data types are defined by user
   itself. Like, defining a class in C++ or a structure.C++ provides the following
   user - defined datatypes :
   Class
   Structure
   Union
   Enumeration
   Typedef
