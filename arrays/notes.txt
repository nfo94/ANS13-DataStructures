- An array is a compound type that defines a sequence of data items of the same
  type
- Arrays have three attributes: type, capacity, and size
- The type of all data items in an array must be the same; the array type is the
  type of the elements
- We cannot change the capacity of the array after it has been declared
- Array size defines the number of valid elements at each moment

Examples:

int scores[6];
Circle crls[4]

- If the array is declared in the global area of the program, each element is
  given a default value according to the array type
- If the array is declared inside a function (including main), the elements are
  filled with garbage values (what is left from the previous use of the memory
  location)
- The more dangerous situation is when we try to store a value in an element
  that is out of range. In this case, we may unintentionally destroy data or
  program code. When the program runs, the result is unpredictable: The program
  may fail or it may produce invalid results. C++ implementations do not give a
  compile-time or run-time warning when these errors occur
